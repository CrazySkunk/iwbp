            <p>
            Well i don know how to say this but i care so much about us more than i could ever care about anything
            in my life, i care about u more than i even care about myself.I'd rather spend a day with u than spend
            10 years in Paris you complete my equation James + Rose -----> satisfaction + contentment + love + eternity
            with you,I'd rather jus smell the scent of you and hear your sweet angelic voice than listen to all the
            melodiuos birds chirping in the morning....Jus the thought of you brightens up my day....with you is where I'd rather
            be.
            </p>
